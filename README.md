## Instructions

### 1. Forking from Github

Forking is the process of making a personal remote copy of the Learn lab.

To get started, in Learn click "View on GitHub".

![View on GitHub](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4wmbuywfusq8l51/2015-09-30%20at%208.17%20PM.png)

Next on Flatiron's Github page for the lab click the Fork button.

Then select your personal Github account as the location to fork to.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Cloning is the process of making a local copy of the lab from your personal remote on GitHub.

<img width="100%" height="auto" src="http://ironboard-curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/front-end/lab-assets/git-workflow-2.png" alt="Git Workflow 2">

To clone, make sure you've first clicked on the SSH link, then click the
copy button next to the Clone URL to copy it to your clipboard.

Next, in Terminal navigate to the parent directory where you would like to place this lab. Then type:  `git clone <paste the clone URL here>`  

Note: You should replace the `<paste the clone URL here>` including the `<` and `>` symbols in the snippet above with your actual clone URL by pressing command+v on mac or ctrl+v on windows. Example: `git clone git@github.com:jongrover/first-lab-000.git`

Don't forget to `cd` into the lab directory that was made when you cloned the lab. Once in the directory, open the directory with your favorite text editor. Try `subl .` to open in Sublime or `atom .` to open in Atom.

This setup, a terminal in the lab's directory and the lab directory open in an editor like Sublime or Atom, that's the state you want to be in when working on a lab on Learn. It means you're ready.

### 3. First test run with `learn`

From your terminal, run the test suite by typing `learn` and hitting enter. You'll see something similar to:

![Failing Test](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0ik01a1urmuw7o6/2015-09-30%20at%207.46%20PM.png)

*Note: My prompt is `// â™¥`, yours might be different. You'll see a terminal prompt generally represented by a `$`. That indicates you're suppose to be typing in terminal.*

You can see your test is currently failing, which is fine, we haven't done any work yet, so it makes sense.

The failure reads: `Make sure you have added a new file or edited edit-me.txt`

### 4. Passing the lab with `learn`

To pass this lab, either make any change to the content of `edit-me.txt` or create a new file.

You can open `edit-me.txt` and you'll see it is currently empty. Add anything to that file, save the file, and then run `learn`, everything should pass.

You can also pass this lab by creating a new file. From Terminal, you can run `touch new-file` to create a new file. Or use your text editor to create a new file and save it. If a new file is added to this lab, when you run `learn`, your tests should pass.

### 5. Stage and Commit Your Changes with `git` CLI

Now that the lab is solved, we need to commit your changes. Don't worry if all these commands don't make total sense yet.

To stage your changes for a commit, type.

`git add .`

5. Commit the file.

`git commit -am "My first commit"`

## 4. Push Your Code to Github

<img width="100%" height="auto" src="http://ironboard-curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/front-end/lab-assets/git-workflow-4.png" alt="Git Workflow 4">

After adding and commiting your most recent work next we want to push our work up to our personal Github remote (origin).

`git push origin master`

![1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/7qta395mpnmst7x/2015-05-03%20at%209.15%20PM.png)

Go to github and confirm the push.

## 5. Opening a Pull Request

Submitting a pull request can be described as the process of asking the maintainer of the Learn lab (upstream remote) to consider pulling (fetching & merging) in your work from your personal remote copy (origin remote). This enables your instructor to see your solution for the lab.

<img width="100%" height="auto" src="http://ironboard-curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/front-end/lab-assets/git-workflow-5.png" alt="Git Workflow 5">

To do so, in Learn click the title of the lab to go to your forked copy on Github.

<img width="100%" height="auto" src="http://ironboard-curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/front-end/lab-assets/ironboard-labs-step-0b.jpg" alt="Ironboard Labs Step 0b">

Then click the green Pull Request button.

After reviewing the comparison code and making sure it shows your solution, click the Create pull request button.
